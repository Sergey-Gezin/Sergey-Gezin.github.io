          <div class="contentTitle">How I've become a data analyst</div>
            <div class="pageContent">
              <p>I had a job as a project manager in a small survey company. But then the corona hit, and like millions of other people, I was grounded in the four walls of my home.</p>
              <p>The only thing that was left for me to do, is to monitor the world situation and in Israel, where I live. I was fascinated, how all the corona statistic websites look. I learned that it is called a dashboard. They all were interactive, beautiful, and most important, very informative. I thought you need to be a programming genius to build something like that. But luckily, I was wrong. Soon I've stumbled upon a Yandex Data Analyst course in Israel - they were recruiting 100 participants. I went through all the screening processes and have been selected to the first cohort from more than 3000 candidates.</p>
              <p>In the following six months I've learned to work with data professionally, to do a complete data analysis using Python and SQL, to analyze all the business metrics, conduct A/B tests, building dashboards with BI tools, and many other things.</p>
			  <p>So now I'm looking for the oportunities to start my new career as Data Analyst. Please check my portfolio, and I'll be glad for any feedback.</p>
